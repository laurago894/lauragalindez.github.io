I am a PhD candidate at the Microelectronics and Sensors (MICAS) lab of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), under the guidance of [Prof. Marian Verhelst](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/micas/index.php/marian-verhelst). My research consists on the proposal of hardware-aware algorithmic strategies for resource scarce application settings. 


Previously, I was a visiting scholar at the [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) in UCLA, where I worked with [Prof. Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/).
