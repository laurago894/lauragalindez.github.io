I am a postdoc at the [Berkeley Wireless Research Center](https://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/) of UC Berkeley, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Rabaey](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/rabaey.html). My research lies at the intersection of probabilistic inference, hyperdimensional computing and hardware-aware machine learning. My current focus is on efficiently incorporating closed loop intelligence to biomedical devices. 

Before joining UC Berkeley, I obtained my PhD from KU Leuven under the supervision of [Prof. Marian Verhelst](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/micas/index.php/marian-verhelst). My dissertation proposed hardware-aware probabilistic models and algoritmic strategies targeting resource scarce applications. During the winter of 2018, I was a visiting scholar at the [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence Lab (StarAI)](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) in UCLA, where I worked with [Prof. Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/). 

I received my Master's degree in Systems and Control from the Mechanical Engineering Department of [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/) in The Netherlands, and my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) in Mexico.
