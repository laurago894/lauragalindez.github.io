I am a postdoc at the [Berkeley Wireless Research Center](https://bwrc.eecs.berkeley.edu/) of UC Berkeley, working under the supervision of [Prof. Jan Rabaey](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/rabaey.html). My research focuses on the development of hybrid cognitive systems that enable reasoning across the levels of abstraction of an application, while remaining aware of the resource constraints of the involved devices. In particular, my current work relies on the integration of probabilistic inference, high-dimensional computing and hardware-aware machine learning.

Before joining UC Berkeley, I obtained my PhD from KU Leuven under the supervision of [Prof. Marian Verhelst](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/micas/index.php/marian-verhelst). My dissertation proposed hardware-aware probabilistic models and algoritmic strategies targeting resource scarce applications. During the winter of 2018, I was a visiting scholar at the [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence Lab (StarAI)](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) in UCLA, where I worked with [Prof. Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/). 

I received my Master's degree in Systems and Control from the Mechanical Engineering Department of [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/) in The Netherlands, and my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics Engineering from [Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) in Mexico.
