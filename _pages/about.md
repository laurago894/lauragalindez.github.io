I am a PhD candidate at the Microelectronics and Sensors (MICAS) lab of [KU Leuven](https://www.kuleuven.be/english/), working with  [Prof. Marian Verhelst](https://www.esat.kuleuven.be/micas/index.php/marian-verhelst) on the proposal of hardware-aware algorithmic strategies for resource scarce application settings . Previously, I was a visiting scholar at the [Statistical and Relational Artificial Intelligence Lab](http://starai.cs.ucla.edu/) in UCLA, where I worked with [Prof. Guy Van den Broeck](http://web.cs.ucla.edu/~guyvdb/). 

Before joining KU Leuven, I received my Master's degree in Systems and Control from the Mechanical Engineering Department of [TU Eindhoven](https://www.tue.nl/en/) in The Netherlands and my Bachelor's degree in Mechatronics from [Tecnologico de Monterrey](https://tec.mx/en) in Mexico.
